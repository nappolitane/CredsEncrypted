# CredsEncrypted Application

This is a repository of a password manager application wannabe. It was made with VS2022 using WPF. Basically, it is a desktop application that encrypts and decrypts files with a given password using AES algorithm. It also allows you to make changes to the encrypted files without decrypting them on disk, only in memory. It saves the encrypted files using Base64 encoding. If used with a strong password, i think it can protect your sensitive files.
